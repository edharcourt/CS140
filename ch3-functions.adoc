== Functions 

Functions play a massively important role in programming. They encapsulate common computations and keep programmers from having to reinvent the wheel.
You can just use the `math.sqrt` function. You don't have to write it yourself. 

Recall that in mathematics a _function_ maps values in a _domain_ to values in a _range_. In Python the `math.sqrt` function maps 4 to 2.0, 9 to 3.0, and 2 to 1.4142135623730951.footnote:[This is only an approximation. The stem:[\sqrt{2}] is _irrational_. That is, it is a never ending, non-repeating sequence of digits.]

The round function maps `round(3.56,1)` to `3.6`. *_Functions return values_*. Always. But sometimes we don't care about the return value. In Python functions sometimes return the special value `None`, which essentially means the function does not "really" return a value.footnote:[In other programming languages such as C and and Java these are called _void_ functions.]. For example, the `print` function returns the value `None` but has the _side effect_ of printing its arguments on the console.

.`print` function

We saw earlier that 

[source,python,numbered]
----
print("Hello World")
----

will print _Hello World_ on the console, but `print` also returned the `None` value.

The following looks strange, but is legit, and almost certainly not what was intended.

[source,python,numbered]
---- 
print(print("Hello World"))
----

.Self Check +++<span style='color:red;margin-right:1.25em; display:inline-block;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>+++
What would get printed by the code above?

[.result]
====

[source,python,numbered]
----
Hello World
None
----

The inner `print` prints _Hello World_ to the console and returns `None` to the outer `print`, which it prints the console. Again, strange, and almost certainly not what was intended. 

====

TIP: `None` is an actual value in Python like `3` and `3,14` and `"Hello"`. It is the value that means _no value_. You will rarely every use it explicitly.

=== Calling Functions

Lets get a little more formal about calling functions. Consider the statement

[source,python,numbered]
print("Hello World")

We say that we are _calling_ the `print` function and _passing_ the argument `Hello World`. Passing an argument means we send the value to the function.

Consider our previous program where we needed to compute stem:[sin(\sqrt{\pi/4})] ...

[source,python,numbered]
----
result = math.sin(math.sqrt(math.pi/4))
print(round(result, 2))
----

.Check Yourself +++<span style='color:red;margin-right:1.25em; display:inline-block;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>+++
How many function calls are there in the two lines above? Explain all of the arguments and return values.

[.result]
====
The first line contains two function calls. First `math.sqrt` is called with the argument `math.pi/4`. Then `math.sin` is called and uses the value returned from the `math.sqrt` call as its arguments. The return value of `math.sin` is then assigned to the variable `result`. The second line contains two function calls as well. First `round` is called with _two_ arguments, `result` and `2`. `result` is the value being rounded and `2` is the number of places to round to. The return value from `round` is then used as the only argument to the `print` function. 

In total there are four function calls and five arguments involved.
====

=== Defining Functions

The real power with functions is that programmers get to define our own. Functions allow us to encapsulate commonly occurring computations. Lets go back to our rather banal example of our formula to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. Rather than having to keep remembering the formula we can just define a function.

.util.py
[source,python,numbered]
----
def f2c(f):              <1>
    c = 5 / 9 * (f - 32) <2>
    return c             <3>
----
	
<1> This is the _function header_. It tells Python we are defining our own function and it takes one _parameter_ `f`. The value of `f` is determined by the argument when `f2c` is called.
<2> This is the main part of the function that does the computation. It defines a _local variable_ `c`.
<3> This is the return statement that indicates that function `f2c` returns the value `c` to the _caller_ that was just computed.

Lines 2 and 3 constitute the _function body_, which is indented under the function header.

We now have our own function for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius and we can tuck it away in a file somewhere so we can reuse it later.

image::f2c-func.png[align="center"]

We can use `f2c` in a program by _calling_ it with an argument.

[source,python]
----
print(f2c(32))
----

We call this the _main program_. The main program is any code that exists outside of a function.

.Self check +++<span style='color:red;margin-right:1.25em; display:inline-block;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>+++
Why is the following line incorrect? +
`f2c(32)`

[.result]
====
Because `f2c` returns a value, and this line does not do anything with that value. It doesn't print it or use it in another computation.
====

It is a common mistake for students to confuse a function _returning a value_ and a _function printing a value_. Consider this version of `f2c`.

[source,python,numbered]
----
def f2c(f):
    c = 5 / 9 * (f - 32)
    print(c)
----

This function returns the value `None` and, as a side effect, prints the value of the variable `c` on the console. This function is not technically wrong. It does not have a syntax error, nor a run-time error, or even a logic error. But it is in some way inferior to the first version of `f2c`. Consider the following program.

[source,python,numbered]
----
t = float(input("Enter a temperature: "))
print(f2c(t) +  100)
----

This program reads a temperature from the user and puts it in the variable `t`. It then converts `t` to Celsius and adds 100 degrees Celsius to the result and printing the final value. For the first version of `f2c` this works fine. But the second version crashes because it tries to add 100 to `None`.
 
WARNING: A function that returns a value is not the same thing as the function printing a value. 

==== Putting functions in a module

Since we will be using the `f2c` function later in the text it is a good idea to place general functions in a module, such as `util.py`.

[source,python,numbered]
----
import util 

t = float(input("Enter a temperature: "))
print(util.f2c(t) +  100)
----

=== Functions for their side effect

Functions return values. Some functions, such as `print`, return `None` but are used for their _side effect_.  
 
Recall our complete blockhead program from before.

====
include::python/blockhead.py[]
====

What if we wanted to draw two or more blockheads on the display surface? One way is to make another copy of the code, and change lots of variable names etc. This is a perfect situation where we can write a function `blockhead` that we can call more than once. 

In keeping with the way drawing rectangle works specifying the Blockhead's stem:[x] and stem:[y] coordinate along with its width and height makes sense:

[source,python,numbered]
----
def draw_blockhead(head_x, head_y, head_w, head_h):
    pass
----
	
This is just the function header. The Python statement `pass` is the statement that does nothing. We are using it here as a placeholder for the function body, which we have not yet written.

So what we'll do now is place all of the code used for the drawing inside the function and make sure that we use the parameters to initialize the 

[source,python,numbered]
----
def draw_blockhead(head_x, head_y, head_w, head_h):

    pygame.draw.rect(win, color.yellow, 
	                (head_x, head_y, head_width, head_height))

    # left eye
    left_eye_x = head_x + head_width // 4
    left_eye_y = head_y + head_height // 4
    left_eye_r = head_width // 12
    pygame.draw.circle(win, color.darkgray, 
	                  (left_eye_x, left_eye_y), left_eye_r)

    # left eye cross
    pygame.draw.line(win, color.white,
                     (left_eye_x, left_eye_y - left_eye_r),
                     (left_eye_x, left_eye_y + left_eye_r))

    pygame.draw.line(win, color.white,
                     (left_eye_x - left_eye_r, left_eye_y),
                     (left_eye_x + left_eye_r, left_eye_y))

    # right eye
    right_eye_x = head_x + 3 * head_width // 4
    right_eye_y = head_y + head_height // 4
	
	right_eye_r = head_width // 12  
    pygame.draw.circle(win, color.darkgray, 
	    (right_eye_x, right_eye_y), right_eye_r)

    # mouth
    mouth_width = head_width // 2
    mouth_height = head_height // 4
    mouth_x = head_x + head_width // 2 - mouth_width // 2
    mouth_y = head_y + 2 * head_height // 3
    pygame.draw.ellipse(win, color.pink, 
	    (mouth_x, mouth_y, mouth_width, mouth_height))

    # smile
    pygame.draw.ellipse(win, color.yellow, 
	    (mouth_x, mouth_y, mouth_width, mouth_height - .2 * mouth_height))

    # add a nose
    nose_width = head_width // 10  # 1/10th width of head
    nose_height = head_height // 4 # 1/4 height of head
    nose_x = head_x + head_width // 2 - nose_width // 2 
    nose_y = head_y + head_height // 2 - nose_height // 2  
    pygame.draw.ellipse(win, color.blue, 
	    (nose_x, nose_y, nose_width, nose_height))
----

Now we can call the `draw_blockhead` function as many times as we like without having to 
duplicate lots of code. The variables `head_x`, `head_y`, `head_w`, `head_h` are _parameters_ and they can be used anywhere in the function body. That is their _scope_.

NOTE: The _scope_ of a variable is the region of the program where it can be used.

All of the other variables that are defined in the function are _local variables_. A local variable's scope is from the point where where it is defined until the end of the function.

NOTE: A _local variable_ is defined in a function. Its scope is the point from where it was defined until the end of the function.

The `draw_blockhead` function still uses the variable `win`, which is neither passed as a parameter nor is it defined with the function. The function assumes `win` is defined in the main program. We say that `win` is a _global variable_.

NOTE: A _global variable_ is defined in the main program. Its scope is the point from where it was defined until the end of the program.

=== Benefits of functions

==== Functions make code more readable 

If you look at the main program above it is clear that the program draws four figures. If we didn't use a function and duplicated the code to draw the figures then it would be far less clear what is going on. 

==== Functions make code less buggy

Imagine had we not used a function and we found an error in the code, we would then have to fix that error in every place where the code was duplicated. When we use a function we just fix it once.

==== Functions make programs more concise

This one is obvious. We don't have to copy and paste code, and the program is much shorter.

==== Functions allow programmers to easily _reuse_ code.

Consider our Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion function `f2c` that we placed in a file `util.py`. We can reuse that function whenever we want without having to reinvent the wheel every time.

Assume that *_C_* is an initial amount of an investment, *_r_* is the yearly rate of interest (e.g., .02 is 2%), *_t_* is the number of years until maturation, *_n_* is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, then the final value of the investment is stem:[p=c(1+r/n)^{tn}]. Write a function `investment` that takes *_C_*, *_r_*, *_n_*, and *_t_* as arguments and returns the final value of the investment to the nearest penny. Test your function with a main program where stem:[C = 1000, r = .01, n = 1, t = 1].
