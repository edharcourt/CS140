== Tuples and Lists

Recall that a _tuple_ is a value that contains a _collection of values_. For example we used a tuple for coordinates, such as `(32,712)` or `(0,0)`. We used a tuple with three integers to specify colors, red is `(255,0,0)`, and yellow is `(255,255,0)`. 

A tuple need not contain integers. Any time we want to think of several values as a single value we can use a tuple. For example, we can use a tuple to hold a name such as `("Harry", "Potter")` which might be more helpful than storing the name as a single string `"Harry Potter"`.

Tuples are also _indexed_ like strings. Just like you can access the _i^th^_ character in a string `s` as `s[i]`, or the first character as `s[0]` we can index tuples as well.

[source,python]
----
name = ("Harry", "Potter")
print(name[1], name[0])
----

prints `Potter Harry`.  Tuples have a length.

[source,python]
----
print(len(name))
----

prints `2`.

We can also use tuples to hold a sequence of values. For example, a collection of grades.

[source,python]
----
grades = (98, 78, 72, 100, 85, 76)
----

Because tuples are a _sequence type_ we can iterate over them just like we can a string. To compute the average grade in `grades` ...

[source,python,numbered]
----
total = 0
for g in grades:
    total += g

avg = total / len(grades)
print("The average is", round(avg,2))
----

Like strings, tuples are _immutable_. Once a tuple is defined it cannot be changed.  For example, using our `grades` tuple if we wanted to modify the first grade to be a 100 we might want to try ...

[source,python]
----
grades[0] = 100
----
causes a run-time error

----
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
----

=== Lists

A list in Python is a lot like a tuple, except that it is _mutable_.

NOTE: A _mutable_ value can be modified.

When defining a list we use square brackets instead of parentheses to define lists.

[source,python]
----
grades = [98, 78, 72, 100, 85, 76]
----

Because lists are mutable we can modify individual elements of the list. 

[source,python]
----
grades[0] = 100 <1>
----
<1> Replaces the 98 with 100.

==== List methods

The list `[]` is the empty list whose length is zero.

[source,python]
----
grades = []
print(len(grades)) <1>
----
<1> prints `0`.

////
- find the median of a list of grades
- replace the smallest grade with the largest grade.
- count the number grades in the 80s
////

We can insert a value at the end of the list using the `append` method.

[source,python]
----
grades.append(78)
grades.append(83) <1>
----
<1> The list is now `[78,83]`

This seems a little verbose since we could have just defined the list as

[source,python]
----
grades = [78,83]
----

But we might not know the exact values in the list. What if they are coming from a file of grades? Or from the Internet? For example, lets compute the _median_ of a file of numbers? The _median_ is the middle number, where half of the numbers are above and below the median. If there is an even number of numbers then the median is the average of the middle two numbers. One way to compute the median is to sort the numbers and pick the middle element. We can't just read a number from the file, add it to an average, forgetting the previous number, like we did when we computed the average of a file of numbers in <<_example_files_of_numbers>>.

To sort a list we can call the `sort` method on the list.

[source,python]
----
grades.sort() <1>
----
<1> Sort the list of grades. The sort method returns `None` and has the side effect of modifying the list. 

[source,python,numbered]
----
f = open('grades.txt')
grades = []

for grade in f:                         <1>
    grades.append(float(grade))  

grades.sort()                       

if len(grades) % 2 == 1:                <2>
    median = grades[len(grades)//2]
else:                                   <3>
    mid1 = grades[len(grades)//2 - 1]   <4>
    mid2 = grades[len(grades)//2]
    median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2

print('Median:', round(median, 1))
----
<1> Append each grade in the file to the list.
<2> For an odd length list, the median is in the middle.
<3> Otherwise we need to compute the mean of the middle two elements.
<4> Convince yourself that the grades at `len(grades)//2 - 1` and `len(grades)//2` are the middle two elements.

=== The Birthday Paradox

The _Birthday Paradox_ (also called the _Birthday Problem_) is a counterintuitive result in probability that asks how many people need to be in a room for there to be a 50% chance that two people share a birthday. As is often the case, many of our examples seem silly, but have real applications. In the area of computer security there is a particular type of attack called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack[_birthday attack_].  The popular radio show _This American Life_ did an https://www.thisamericanlife.org/630/things-i-mean-to-know[episode] titled https://www.thisamericanlife.org/630/things-i-mean-to-know/act-one-0[_Fraud Complex_] where the results from the birthday paradox were used to debunk claims of voter
fraud.footnote:[https://5harad.com/papers/1p1v.pdf[_One Person, One Vote:
Estimating the Prevalence of Double Voting
in U.S. Presidential Elections_]] 

The mathematics for solving the birthday problem, while not all that complicated, is beyond the scope of this text. However, writing a program to simulate the birthday problem is fairly straightforward.

There are 366 possible birthdays (including the leap year day February 29). We can think of the calendar as a list of 366 integers. Call this list `birthdays`. The number of people in the room that share January 1 as a birthday is in `birthdays[0]` and the number that share December 31 is in `birthdays[365]`.  Initially `birthdays` is initialized to all zeros.

[source,python,numbered]
----
birthdays = []

for i in range(366):    <1>
    birthdays.append(0)
----
<1> Append 366 zeros to the `birthdays` list.

Python has an even simpler notation for initializing a list to all
of the same value. We can replicate all three line of code above
with the one line ...

[source,python]
----
birthdays = [0]*366
----

How can we simulate someone's birthday?  Generate a random number between 0 and 365
and increment the corresponding birthday in the `birthdays` list.

[source,python,numbered]
----
bday = random.randrange(366)
birthdays[bday] += 1
----

We need to do this a number of times, once for each person in the room. How many times? This is precisely what we are trying to figure out. Lets start with 100. 

[source,python,numbered]
----
for i in range(100):                <1>
    bday = random.randrange(366)
    birthdays[bday] += 1
----
<1> Generate one hundred random birthdays.

How do we know if two or more people share a birthday? One of the items in the `birthdays` list will be greater than 1. If nobody shared a birthday then all of the integers in `birthdays` are either 0 or 1. By the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle[_pigeonhole principle_] if there are 367 people in the room then we are guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. In practice though, it is much less than that.

[source,python,numbered]
----
i = 0
for count in birthdays:
    if count > 1:
        print(count, "birthdays on day", i)
    i = i + 1
----

Rewrite the above loop so that it uses the other form of a `for`-loop using the `range` function.

[.result]
====

[source,python,numbered]
----
for i in range(len(birthdays)):
    if birthdays[i] > 1:
        print(birthdays[i], 'birthdays on day', i)
----
====

If we run this with 100 people in the room we see that lots of people share a birthday. (You will get different results because we are generating random birthdays).

----
2 birthdays on day 10
2 birthdays on day 23
2 birthdays on day 49
2 birthdays on day 69
3 birthdays on day 95
2 birthdays on day 144
2 birthdays on day 178
2 birthdays on day 290
3 birthdays on day 315
2 birthdays on day 316
2 birthdays on day 333
----

In fact with 100 people, you are almost guaranteed to have people share a birthday. With a little experimenting you can see that at about 23 people there is a 50% chance of two or more people sharing a birthday. It is called the _Birthday Paradox_ because that 23 _seems_ like a surprisingly small number.

=== Particle Simulation: Take 2

Recall our particle simulation in <<_case_study_particles_and_collision>> where we had two particles moving and colliding.  For each particle we defined four variables `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. For two particles we need eight variables, and if we had six particles then we would need twenty-four variables. Also,our condition for checking collisions gets very long. We would have to check particle 1 against particles 2 through 6, particle 2 against particles 3 through 6
and so on. That would be stem:[5+4+3+2+1 = 15] conditions. In general if we had stem:[n] particles we need 

stem:[n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \cdots + 3 + 2 + 1 = n(n-1)/2] 

conditions. So 100 particles would be stem:[4950] conditions. 

Rather than having separate variables for each _x_ coordinate we can keep a _list of x coordinates_ where `x[0]` is the x-coordinate for the first particle, `x[1]` for the second particle, and so on. 

We will do the same thing for the y-coordinates. 

[source,python]
----
x = []  # list of x-coordinates. x[i] is the x-coordinate for particle i
y = []  # list of y-coordinates. y[i] is the y-coordinate for particle i
----

Assuming `side` is the height and width of the display and `r` is the radius of the particle (`ball.get_width()//2`) we can use two nested for-loops to distribute the particles evenly over the display.  

[source,python,numbered]
----
for row in range(r, side, 6*r):      <1>
    for col in range(r, side, 6*r):
        x.append(col)
        y.append(row)
----
<1> Start at `r` so that the first particle is off of the edge a bit. Increment in steps of `6*r` so that there is some space between the particles.

We might want to verify that the code above works. We should check it by displaying the particles on the Pygame window.

.Check Yourself +++<span style='color:red;margin-right:1.25em; display:inline-block;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>+++
Write a Python code fragment that would display the particles on the Pygame display.

[.result]
====
We need to loop through all of the `x` and `y` coordinates and 
`blit` each particle to the disaply.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(len(x)):           <1>
    win.blit(ball, (x[i], y[i]))
pygame.display.update()
----
<1> We could have used the `len(y)` here as well. The two lists are the same length.

And what we get should be something like the image ...

image::nparticles.png[align="center",width=300]
====

We also need to give each particle a velocity. And we want to give them different velocities, otherwise they would all move in the same direction at the same speed.

Since each particle will have its own velocity we will need a list
of x-velocities and a list of y-velocities.

[source,python]
----
dx = []   # list of x-velocities. dx[i] is the x velocity for particle i
dy = []   # list of y-velocities. dy[i] is the y velocity for particle i
----

We saw that in our discussion of the frame rate (<<_understanding_the_frame_rate>>) if the width of the window was 600 pixels and we set a particle's x-velocity `dx` to 600 pixels per second, the particle would travel across the screen in one second. If we wanted the particle to travel across the screen in 2 seconds we would set `dx` to `side/2` (or 300 pixels per second) assuming `side` is the width of the window. We want to give particles different velocities to make it look realistic. We can randomize the velocity of the particle between `side/2` and `side/4` seconds. For example, setting the x-velocity and y-velocity to `side / (random.random() * 2 + 2)`

Why does this work? Well `random.random() * 2` gives a random value between 0 and 2` and adding 2 gives us a random value between 2 and 4.

But this means that all of the velocities are positive and all of the particles would be traveling to the right and down the display. We need some of the velocities to be negative, between -2 and -4. We have to be careful because we don't want to generate values near `0` such as `.001` because then `side/.001` would be far too fast.

image::numberline.png[align="center",width="400"]

It is probably easiest to just toss a coin and randomly negate the value `side / (random.random() * 2 + 2)`

Our code for initializing the positions and velocities of each particle is ...

.Initializing the particles
[source,python,numbered]
----
import pygame, color, random
pygame.init()
side = 600
win = pygame.display.set_mode((side,side))

ball = pygame.image.load("../images/ball.png").convert_alpha()
r = ball.get_width()//2

for row in range(r, side, 6*r):
    for col in range(r, side, 6*r):
        x.append(col)
        y.append(row)

        # generate random velocities
        tdx = side / (random.random() * 2 + 2) <1>
        tdy = side / (random.random() * 2 + 2) <2>
   
        if random.random() < .5:               <3>
            tdx = -tdx

        if random.random() < .5:               <4>
            tdy = -tdy

        dx.append(tdx)
        dy.append(tdy)
----
<1> Generate a random x-velocity value between `side/2` and `side/4`.
<2> The same for the y-velocity.
<3> Randomly negate the x-velocity
<4> And the same for the y-velocity.

==== Moving the Particles

To move the particles we will use the same structure as we did when were animating just two particles. The main animation loop stays the same.

.Animation Loop
[source,python,numbered]
----
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while True:
    win.fill(color.lightgray)
    dt = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0
   
    # code to move and blit each particle goes here

    pygame.display.update()
----

Back when we were animating two particles we had two separate calls to the 
`move` function. If we had three particles we had three distinct calls to `move`. But here we are using lists and we want to move the _i^th^_ particle.

[source,python]
----
(x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i]) = move(x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i])
----
 
where _i_ loops through all of thr particles.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(len(x)):
    (x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i]) = move(x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i])
    win.blit(ball, (x[i], y[i])) <1>
----
<1>  Don't forget to `blit` the particle.

Putting this all together we have the code to animate the particles.

.Animating the particles. 
[source,python,numbered]
----
while True:
    win.fill(color.lightgray)
    dt = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0

    for i in range(len(x)):
        (x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i]) = move(x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i])
        win.blit(ball, (x[i], y[i]))

    pygame.display.update()
----

==== Colliding the Particles

Assume we have stem:[n] particles. We need to collide particle `0` with particles `1`, `2`, ..., `n-1` and particle `2` with `3`, `4`, ..., `n-1`. 
In general we collide particle `i` with particles `i+1`, `i+2`, ..., `n-1`.

.Collision Pattern
[width="33%",options="header"]
|===
|Particle _i_  | Collides with particles
|0
|1, 2, 3, ... , stem:[n-1]

|1
|2, 3, ..., stem:[n-1]

|...
|...

|stem:[n-3]
|stem:[n-2], stem:[n-1]

|stem:[n-2]	
|stem:[n-1]
|=== 

When we get to the last particle, stem:[n-1], it has no other particles to collide with that 
we have not already checked.

[source,python,numbered]
----
for i in range(len(x) - 1):          <1>
    for j in range(i+1, len(x)):     <2>
        # collide particle i and j
----  
<1> for every particle `i` except the last
<2> for every particle from `i+1` to the last

Now we just add the conditional that if the distance between the centers of the two particles is less than two radii then they need to exchange velocities.

[source,python,numbered]
----
if distance(x[i] + r, y[i] + r, x[j] + r, y[j] + r) < 2 * r:
    (dx[i], dx[j]) = (dx[j], dx[i])
    (dy[i], dy[j]) = (dy[j], dy[i])
----

Putting it all together 

[source,python,numbered]
----
for i in range(len(x) - 1):
    for j in range(i+1, len(x)):
        if distance(x[i] + r, y[i] + r, x[j] + r, y[j] + r) < 2 * r:
            (dx[i], dx[j]) = (dx[j], dx[i])
            (dy[i], dy[j]) = (dy[j], dy[i])
----

This goes in the main animation loop, which is now 

[source,python,numbered,]
----
# main animation loop
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while True:
    win.fill(color.lightgray)
    dt = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0

	# move the particles
    for i in range(len(x)):                                                
        (x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i]) = move(x[i],y[i],dx[i],dy[i])
        win.blit(ball, (x[i], y[i]))

	# collide the particles
    for i in range(len(x) - 1):                                            
        for j in range(i+1, len(x)):
            if distance(x[i] + r, y[i] + r, x[j] + r, y[j] + r) < 2 * r:
                (dx[i], dx[j]) = (dx[j], dx[i])
                (dy[i], dy[j]) = (dy[j], dy[i])
