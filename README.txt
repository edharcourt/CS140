These notes are a work in progress from the Introduction to Computer Programming (CS140) course that I have been teaching at St. Lawrence Univeristy since 2003.  In particular, I have not finished citing sources or adding references. These are on github for my own convenience. But of course please feel free to beg/borrow/steal whatever you like.
