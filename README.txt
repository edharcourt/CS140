These notes are a work in progress from the Introduction to Computer Programming (CS140) course that I have been teaching at St. Lawrence Univeristy since 2003.  In particular, I have not finished citing sources or adding references. These notes and files are on github for my own convenience. If you happen to find this feel free to borrow whatever you like, but it would be nice to know about it.
